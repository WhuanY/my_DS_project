    "Linear regression excels at extrapolating trends, but can't learn interactions. XGBoost excels at learning interactions, but can't extrapolate trends. In this lesson, we'll learn how to create **\"hybrid\"** forecasters that combine complementary learning algorithms and let the strengths of one make up for the weakness of the other."

Many time series can be closely described by an additive model of just these three components plus some essentially unpredictable, entirely random error:\n",
